# Bayesian-Linear-Regression

The purpose of this project is to provide a bayesian analysis on some real data, with the use of MCMC simulations within the OpenBUGS software. The analysis will focus on a linear regression on the data â€˜[Small Area Estimation of Average Income](https://sites.google.com/a/r-inla.org/stbook/datasets).

The analysis was done with the R language.
